This Cadence program is a simple "RentCar" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a single function that store a object in a dictiorany. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Cadence programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Play Flow, an online Flow IDE. To get started, go to the Play flow website at https://play.flow.com/.

Once you are on the Flow website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract HelloWorld {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}

```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "sayHello" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
